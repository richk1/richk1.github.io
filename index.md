## About Me
I used to do programming for a living, but now I'm just a hobbiest. I've learned, and then forgotten, how to use many different programming languages in the past. When I have the time and the mood hits me, I like writing code and working out how to make useful software, mainly for myself and maybe my friends and family. I'm not looking for another coding job - things tend to cease being fun when you HAVE TO do them.

## Goals
1. As time goes by the number of languages, frameworks, libraries, etc. seems to expand quickly, and even the implementations of those are constantly changing. This makes it practically impossible for a single person to keep current with all the trends in software development, and requires one to restrict onself to a select few. My current focus is DotNet/C#, which I'm mostly doing for the Windows desktop. The reason for concentrating on DotNet/C# is that I'd like to find and master(?) the smallest set of languages that I can use for just about any environment (desktop, phone, tablet, web) and DotNet seems to be (IMO) the best bet for that at the moment - though there are other competitors (I experimented with Flutter a while back but it didn't really support desktop then and learning materials were a bit sparse.)
2. This GitHub Pages site is really just another experiment of mine to see how it works.

## My Repositories
Most of my repositories are private, since they're mostly just experiments that no one else would be much interested in seeing, or they would just confuse people because of the muddled state they're in. Cleaning them up and maintaining them in a presentable state is more work than its worth. As I'm writing this, I've got just two public code repositories, both fairly old. Both are pretty primative programs. 
* The older one is a [TicTacToe](https://github.com/richk1/PythonTicTacToe) game written in Python with a TK UI. 
* The newer one is a [HelloWorld](https://github.com/richk1/HelloWorldRUI) program written in C# using the ReactiveUI framework. 

I do have a much more complex application written using ReactiveUI that I use to monitor my internet connection, but I don't think a lot of it is written particularly well - so its not a public repo. I think a reasonable number of people have looked at the HelloWorld app, but I found the functional coding style that reactive programming prefers was a little too foreign to me, and I've doubled back to learning C# WPF style coding basics more thoroughly before I possibly attempt the reactive/functional stuff again.
